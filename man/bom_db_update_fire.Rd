\title{Calculate values of fire-related variables in the database tables}
\usage{
bom_db_update_fire(
  db,
  tables = c("aws", "synoptic"),
  records = c("new", "all"),
  stations = NULL,
  av.rainfall.method = c("metadata", "records"),
  min.days.required = 30,
  quiet = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{db}{A database connection pool object.}

\item{tables}{Names of tables to update. The default is to only update the
'AWS' table. Table names may be abbreviated.}

\item{records}{The records to update: either \code{'new'} (default) to only
update records with more recent dates and times than the last record with
calculated values; or \code{'all'} to calculate values for all records in a
table, replacing any previously calculated values. Note that for both
options, values can only be calculated for records that form a continuous
time series.}

\item{stations}{An optional vector of integer station numbers. If provided,
updates will only be performed for these stations. The default is to
update all stations.}

\item{av.rainfall.method}{Either 'metadata' (default and recommended) to take
average rainfall values from the \code{STATIONS_METADATA} table; or
'records' to calculate average rainfall from station records over the period
2001 - 2015. With the latter option, any station that does not have data
for the whole of the reference period will be ignored.}

\item{min.days.required}{The minimum number of days of data required to
perform calculations for a station. The default and smallest allowable
value is 30 days. The number of days is determined by counting distict
record dates. This does not consider gaps (missing days) in the time
series.}

\item{quiet}{If \code{TRUE}, do not print progress information (table and
station names) to the console during processing. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A vector with named elements giving the number of records updated by
  table.
}
\description{
This function calculates and stores values for the database fields 'kbdi'
(Keetch-Bryam Drought Index), 'drought' (Drought Factor), and 'ffdi' (Forest
Fire Danger Index) for records in one or both of the 'AWS' and 'Synoptic'
database tables. Calculations are performed by the function
\code{bom_db_calculate_ffdi}. Depending on the value of the \code{records}
argument, values can be calculated for all records (any previous values are
replaced), or only for those records with more recent dates and times than
the last record with non-missing values. The records must cover a continuous
time series, i.e. no gaps in the sequence of dates.
}
\details{
KBDI calculations require an average annual precipitation value. This can
either be taken from the station values in the \code{\link{STATION_METADATA}}
table, derived from the NARCLIM 'p12' layer, or calculated from stations
records for the 2001-2015 period. The default, and recommended option, is to
use the NARCLIM station values. Note that at present the database does not
record which option was used so it is up to you to be consistent (!)
